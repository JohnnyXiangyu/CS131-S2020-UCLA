speedup result:
    | ?- speedup(A).

    A = 77.777777777777771 ?

here is an ambiguous puzzle I found:
    C = counts([1,3,3,3,2],[4,1,2,2,3],[1,2,2,3,2],[2,1,3,2,4])
with the following 2 solutions:
    T1 = [[5,3,1,2,4],[4,2,3,1,5],[2,1,5,4,3],[3,4,2,5,1],[1,5,4,3,2]]
    T2 = [[5,3,1,2,4],[4,2,3,1,5],[3,1,5,4,2],[1,4,2,5,3],[2,5,4,3,1]]
